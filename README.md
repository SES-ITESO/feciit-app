# Feciit App

## About the Stack

### Vue.js

Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It provides a reactive data-binding system and composable component architecture, making it easy to build interactive web applications.

### Nuxt

Nuxt is a full-stack framework built on top of Vue that provides server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), file-based routing, auto-imports, and many other features out of the box. It simplifies the development experience while enabling high-performance applications.
